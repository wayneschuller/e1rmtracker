# Google App Script to process and graph strength progress in Google Sheets

Assuming you have clasp installed: https://github.com/google/clasp
clasp login  (this will open a browser to authenticate with your google account)

To run the strength tracker, check out the repo and in the same folder run:
clasp create --title "Strength Tracker Sheet"  (choose Sheet from the menu)
clasp push

You will now have a Google Sheet where you can insert your BLOC csv data.
